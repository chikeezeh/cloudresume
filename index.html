                <h3>Tulane University</h3>
                <a>Research Scientist, Data Analytics</a><br> August 2013 - October 2018
                <ul>
                    <li>Leveraging the power of High Performance Computing (HPC) and parallel processing, I developed an
                        image classification model for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and oil spill remediation using MATLAB
                        and OpenCV. The model was efficiently executed on an HPC infrastructure managed by the SLURM
                        workload manager, which significantly streamlined the computational operations. As a result, this
                        led to a 50% increase in efficiency in the selection process of suitable surfactants for EOR, drastically
                        reducing the overall computational time and accelerating the decision-making process.</li>
                    <li>Gained hands-on experience with Linux system administration, specifically in RedHat and CentOS
                        environments, enhancing system performance and reliability during intensive computational tasks.</li>
                    <li>Developed experimental technique for studying high temperature effects on flow in porous media at microscopic scale.</li>
                    <li>Performed statistical analysis such as correlations, trend analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression,logistics linear-regression on experimental data using Excel and Python.</li>
                    <li>Developed complex simulation models using batch system SLURM, effectively managing computational
                        resources in an HPC environment and leading to more efficient data processing and analysis.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Overview: An internal reporting tool was built in Python to send SQL queries to a large database and answer certain business related questions.</li>
                    <li>The SQL queries employed views to help in writing readable queries.</li>
                    <li>The Python program uses the psycopg2 module to communicate with the database.</li>

                    <li>The app was built with the Flask framework, and SQLalchemy was used as an ORM.</li>
                    <li>Google OAUTH2 was used for user registration and authentication.</li>

                    <li>Built the web app to be responsive using CSS Grid.</li>
                    <li>Used Knockout.js as a Model View Controller organizational framework to separate concerns.</li>
